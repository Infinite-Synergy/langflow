---

Langflow is a visual framework for building AI applications. It is open-source, Python-powered, fully customizable, and doesn't require specific large language models (LLMs) or vector stores.

The visual editor simplifies prototyping of application workflows, enabling developers to quickly turn their ideas into powerful, real-world solutions.

## Who should use Langflow?


### Use cases

Langflow can be used for a wide range of AI applications.
For example:

* [Craft intelligent chatbots](/memory-chatbot)
* [Build document analysis systems](/document-qa)
* [Generate compelling content](/blog-writer)
* [Orchestrate multi-agent applications](/simple-agent)
* [Create agents with Langflow](/agents)
* [Use Langflow as an MCP server](/mcp-server)
* [Use Langflow as an MCP client](/mcp-client)


## Create flows in minutes

A _flow_ is a functional representation of an application workflow.
Flows receive input, process it, and produce output.

To build a flow, you connect and configure component nodes. Each component is a single step in the workflow.

With Langflow's [visual editor](/concepts-overview), you can drag and drop components to build a flow in minutes.

For more information, see [Create and manage flows](/concepts-flows).

## Test flows in the Playground

You can use the [Playground](/concepts-playground) to test flows without having to build your entire application stack.

The Playground allows you to interact with your flows and get real-time feedback about flow logic and response generation.

You can also run individual components to test dependencies in isolation.

## Try it

Build and run your first flow in minutes.
