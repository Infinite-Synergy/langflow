Langflow provides several ways to share and integrate your flows into external applications.
For example, you can to the following:

* [Trigger flows with the Langflow API](#api-access)
* [Add an embedded chat widget to a website](#embedded-chat-widget)
* [Access a Langflow MCP server](#access-a-langflow-mcp-server)
* [Share a public flow Playground](#share-a-flows-playground)

This guide introduces the options available for accessing flows from outside a local Langflow UI.

Although you can use these options with a local Langflow instance, these options are more valuable when you have deployed a Langflow server or packaged Langflow as a dependency of an application.
For more information, see [Deployment overview](/deployment-overview) and [Application development overview](/develop-application).

## Use the Langflow API to run flows {#api-access}

<!-- tODO: revise this section -->
Langflow provides Python, JavaScript, and curl code snippets to help you get started with the Langflow API.

These code snippets are available on each flow's **API access** pane.
To access the **API access** pane, open a flow in Langflow, click **Share**, and then click **API access**.

![API access pane](/img/api-pane.png)

You can run the snippet as is, or use the snippet as a basis for a larger script.

For more information and examples, see [Run your flows from external applications](/get-started-quickstart#run-your-flows-from-external-applications) and [Get started with the Langflow API](/api-reference-api-examples).

### Authentication

<!-- TODO Link to api key page -->

### Input schema and tweaks

<!-- TODO: Revise this section and combine w/ temp overrides section -->

Tweaks are added to the `payload` of requests to Langflow's `/run` endpoint to temporarily change component parameters within your flow.
They don't modify the underlying flow configuration or persist between runs.

To assist with formatting, you can define tweaks in Langflow's **Input Schema** pane before copying the code snippet.

For more information, see [Use tweaks to apply temporary overrides to a flow run](/get-started-quickstart#use-tweaks-to-apply-temporary-overrides-to-a-flow-run).

### Temporary overrides and tweaks

The **Temporary overrides** tab displays flow parameters that you can modify at runtime.

Modifying these parameters changes those values across all code snippets.
However, these changes don't persist into the visual editor, and they aren't saved.

For example, changing the **Chat Input** component's `input_value` changes that value across all API `/run` code snipepts.

For more information, see the tweaks example in the [Langflow quickstart](/get-started-quickstart#use-tweaks-to-apply-temporary-overrides-to-a-flow-run).

### Send files to your flow with the API

For information on sending files to the Langflow API, see [Files endpoint](/api-files).

## Embed a flow into a website {#embedded-chat-widget}

For each flow, Langflow provides a code snippet that you can insert into the `<body>` of your website's HTML to interact with your flow through an embedded chat widget.

:::important Required components
The chat widget only supports flows that have **Chat Input** and **Chat Output** components, which are required for the chat experience.
**Text Input** and **Text Output** components can send and receive messages, but they don't include ongoing LLM chat context.

Attempting to chat with a flow that doesn't have a valid input component will trigger the flow, but the response only indicates that the input was empty.
:::

### Get a langflow-chat snippet

To get a flow's embedded chat widget code snippet, do the following:

1. In Langflow, open the flow you want to embed.
2. Click **Share**, and then select **Embed into site**.
3. Copy the code snippet and use it in the `<body>` of your website's HTML.

The chat widget is implemented as a web component called `langflow-chat` that is loaded from a CDN. For more information, see the [langflow-embedded-chat repository](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow-embedded-chat).
For an interactive code example, see the [Langflow embedded chat CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/langflow-embedded-chat-example-dv9zpx).

To use the embedded chat widget in your HTML, the `langflow-chat` web component must include the following minimum inputs (also known as [props](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) in React):

* `host_url`: Your Langflow server URL. Must be `HTTPS`. Cannot include a trailing `/`.
* `flow_id`: The ID of the flow you want to embed.

The minimum inputs are automatically populated in the **Embed into site** code snippet that is generated by Langflow.

For example, the following HTML embeds a chat widget for a [Basic prompting flow](/basic-prompting) hosted on a Langflow server deployed on ngrok:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/logspace-ai/langflow-embedded-chat@main/dist/build/static/js/bundle.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <langflow-chat
      host_url="https://c822-73-64-93-151.ngrok-free.app"
      flow_id="dcbed533-859f-4b99-b1f5-16fce884f28f"
    ></langflow-chat>
  </body>
</html>
```

When this code is deployed to a live site, it renders as a responsive chatbot.
If a user interacts with the chatbot, the input triggers the specified flow, and then the chatbot returns the output from the flow run.

### Embed the chat widget with React or Angular

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="react" label="React" default>

To use the chat widget in your React application, create a component that loads the widget script and renders the chat interface:

1. Declare your web component and encapsulate it in a React component.

    ```javascript
    declare global {
    namespace JSX {
        interface IntrinsicElements {
        "langflow-chat": any;
        }
    }
    }

    export default function ChatWidget({ className }) {
    return (
        <div className={className}>
        <langflow-chat
            host_url="https://c822-73-64-93-151.ngrok-free.app"
            flow_id="dcbed533-859f-4b99-b1f5-16fce884f28f"
        ></langflow-chat>
        </div>
    );
    }
    ```

2. Place the component anywhere in your code to display the chat widget.

    For example, in this docset, the React widget component is located at `docs/src/components/ChatWidget/index.tsx`.

    `index.tsx` includes a script to load the chat widget code from CDN and initialize the `ChatWidget` component with props pointing to a Langflow server.

    ```javascript
    import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

    // Component to load the chat widget script
    const ChatScriptLoader = () => {
    useEffect(() => {
        if (!document.querySelector('script[src*="langflow-embedded-chat"]')) {
        const script = document.createElement('script');
        script.src = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/langflow-ai/langflow-embedded-chat@main/dist/build/static/js/bundle.min.js';
        script.async = true;
        document.body.appendChild(script);
        }
    }, []);

    return null;
    };

    declare global {
    namespace JSX {
        interface IntrinsicElements {
        "langflow-chat": any;
        }
    }
    }

    export default function ChatWidget({ className }) {
    return (
        <div className={className}>
        <ChatScriptLoader />
        <langflow-chat
            host_url="https://c822-73-64-93-151.ngrok-free.app"
            flow_id="dcbed533-859f-4b99-b1f5-16fce884f28f"
        ></langflow-chat>
        </div>
    );
    }
    ```

3. To import the component to a page, include the following import statement:

    ```
    import ChatWidget from '@site/src/components/ChatWidget';
    ```

4. To display the widget, add the following code to the desired location on the page:

   ```
   <ChatWidget className="my-chat-widget" />
   ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="angular" label="Angular">

<!-- TODO: revise -->
To use the chat widget in your [Angular](https://angular.dev/overview) application, create a component that loads the widget script and renders the chat interface.

Angular requires you to explicitly allow custom web components, like `langflow-chat`, in your site's  `components`.
Therefore, you must add the `<langflow-chat>` element to your Angular template and configure Angular to recognize it.
You must add `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` to your module's configuration to enable this.

To add `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` to your module's configuration, do the following:

1. Open the module file `.module.ts` where you want to add the `langflow-chat` web component.
2. Import `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` at the top of the `.module.ts` file:

`import { NgModule, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';`

3. Add `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` to the `schemas` array inside the `@NgModule` decorator:

```javascript
import { NgModule, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule
  ],
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

4. Add the chat widget to your component's template by including the `langflow-chat` element in your component's `.component.ts` file:

For style properties that accept `JSON` objects like `chat_window_style` and `bot_message_style`, use Angular's property binding syntax `[propertyName]` to pass them as JavaScript objects.

```javascript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <div class="container">
      <h1>Langflow Chat Test</h1>
      <langflow-chat
        host_url="https://c822-73-64-93-151.ngrok-free.app"
        flow_id="dcbed533-859f-4b99-b1f5-16fce884f28f"
        [chat_window_style]='{"backgroundColor": "#ffffff"}'
        [bot_message_style]='{"color": "#000000"}'
        [user_message_style]='{"color": "#000000"}'
        window_title="Chat with us"
        placeholder="Type your message..."
        height="600"
        width="400"
        chat_position="bottom-right"
      ></langflow-chat>
    </div>
  `,
  styles: [`
    .container {
      padding: 20px;
      text-align: center;
    }
  `]
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Langflow Chat Test';
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Customize the chat widget
<!-- TODO: Revise & combine w following section -->
You can use additional inputs (or props) to modify the embedded chat widget.

All props and their types are listed in [index.tsx](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow-embedded-chat/blob/main/src/index.tsx) in the langflow-embedded-chat repository.

For example, you can use `chat_window_style` to pass JSON-formatted style elements:

```html
  <langflow-chat
    host_url="https://c822-73-64-93-151.ngrok-free.app"
    flow_id="dcbed533-859f-4b99-b1f5-16fce884f28f"
    chat_window_style='{
      "backgroundColor": "#1a0d0d",
      "border": "4px solid #b30000",
      "borderRadius": "16px",
      "boxShadow": "0 8px 32px #b30000",
      "color": "#fff",
      "fontFamily": "Georgia, serif",
      "padding": "16px"
    }'
    window_title="Custom Styled Chat"
    height="600"
    width="400"
  ></langflow-chat>
```

The following example adds a custom [session ID](/session-id) and Langflow API key.
The session ID helps you identify flow runs started by the embeded chat widget, and the Langflow API key is used by the chat widget for authentication to your Langflow server.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/logspace-ai/langflow-embedded-chat@main/dist/build/static/js/bundle.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <langflow-chat
      host_url="https://c822-73-64-93-151.ngrok-free.app"
      flow_id="dcbed533-859f-4b99-b1f5-16fce884f28f"
      api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
      session_id="YOUR_SESSION_ID"
    ></langflow-chat>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Chat widget configuration

Use the widget API to customize your chat widget.

Props with the type `JSON` need to be passed as stringified JSON, with the format \{"key":"value"\}.

All props and their types are listed in [index.tsx](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow-embedded-chat/blob/main/src/index.tsx).

| Prop                  | Type    | Description                                    |

## Access a Langflow MCP server

Each [Langflow project](/concepts-flows#projects) has an MCP server that exposes the project's flows as tools that MCP clients can use to generate responses.

You can also use Langflow as an MCP client, and you can serve your flows as tools to the Langflow MCP client.

For more information, see [Use Langflow as an MCP server](/mcp-server) and [Use Langflow as an MCP client](/mcp-client).

## Share a flow's Playground

:::important
The **Sharable Playground** is for testing purposes only.

The **Playground** isn't meant for embedding flows in applications. For information about running flows in applications or websites, see the following:

* [Embed a flow into a website](#embedded-chat-widget)
* [Use the Langflow API to run flows](#api-access)
* [About developing and configuring Langflow applications](/develop-overview)
:::

The **Shareable playground** option exposes the [**Playground**](/concepts-playground) for a single flow at the `/public_flow/$FLOW_ID` endpoint.

After you [deploy a public Langflow server](/deployment-overview), you can share this public URL with another user to allow them to access the specified flow's **Playground** only.
The user can interact with the flow's chat input and output and view the results without installing Langflow or generating a Langflow API key.

<!--TODO_Expose_For_1.5
To share a flow's **Playground** with another user, do the following:

1. In Langflow, open the flow you want share.

2. From the **Workspace**, click **Share**, and then enable **Shareable Playground**.

3. Click **Shareable Playground** again to open the **Playground** window.
This window's URL is the flow's **Sharable Playground** address, such as `https://3f7c-73-64-93-151.ngrok-free.app/playground/d764c4b8-5cec-4c0f-9de0-4b419b11901a`.

4. Send the URL to another user to give them access to the flow's **Playground**.
