Langflow provides an API key functionality that allows users to access their individual components and flows.

## Auto-login and API key authentication

Prior to Langflow v1.5, when `AUTO_LOGIN` was enabled with `AUTO_LOGIN=true`, Langflow automatically logged users in as a superuser without requiring authentication, and API requests could be made without a Langflow API key.

As of Langflow v1.5, all API requests require a Langflow API key, even when `AUTO_LOGIN` is enabled.
The MCP-related endpoints will continue to require no authentication when `AUTO_LOGIN=true`.

## Generate a Langflow API key

Generate a user-specific token to use with Langflow.

### Generate an API key with the Langflow UI

1. Click your user icon, and then select **Settings**.
2. Click **Langflow API Keys**, and then click **Add New**.
3. Name your key, and then click **Create API Key**.
4. Copy the API key and store it in a secure location.

### Generate an API key with the Langflow CLI

If you're serving your flow with `--backend-only=true`, you don't have a way to create an API key within the UI.

To create API keys with the Langflow CLI, `AUTO_LOGIN` must be set to `FALSE` and you must be logged in as a superuser.

To create an API key for a user from the CLI, do the following:

1. In your `.env` file, set `AUTO_LOGIN=FALSE`, and set superuser credentials for your server.

    ```text
    LANGFLOW_AUTO_LOGIN=False
    LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER=administrator
    LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=securepassword
    ```

2. To confirm your superuser status, check that `is_superuser` is `true` in the response from the [users/whoami](/api-users#get-current-user) endpoint.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET \
      "$LANGFLOW_URL/api/v1/users/whoami" \
      -H "accept: application/json" \
      -H "x-api-key: $LANGFLOW_API_KEY"
    ```

    Result:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "07e5b864-e367-4f52-b647-a48035ae7e5e",
      "username": "langflow",
      "profile_image": null,
      "store_api_key": null,
      "is_active": true,
      "is_superuser": true,
      "create_at": "2025-05-08T17:59:07.855965",
      "updated_at": "2025-05-29T15:06:56.157860",
      "last_login_at": "2025-05-29T15:06:56.157016",
    }
    ```

2. To create an API key, run:

    ```shell
    uv run langflow api-key
    ```

## Authenticate requests with the Langflow API key

Include your API key in API requests to authenticate requests to Langflow.

API keys allow access only to the flows and components of the specific user to whom the key was issued.

### Include the API key in the HTTP header

To use the API key when making API requests, include the API key in the HTTP header:

```shell
curl -X POST \
  "http://LANGFLOW_SERVER_ADDRESS/api/v1/run/FLOW_ID?stream=false" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: LANGFLOW_API_KEY' \
  -d '{"inputs": {"text":""}, "tweaks": {}}'
```

### Include the API key as a query parameter

To pass the API key as a query parameter:

```shell
curl -X POST \
  "http://LANGFLOW_SERVER_ADDRESS/api/v1/run/FLOW_ID?x-api-key=LANGFLOW_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"inputs": {"text":""}, "tweaks": {}}'
```

## Generate a Langflow secret key

Langflow uses the [Fernet](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) library for encrypting sensitive data.

If no `LANGFLOW_SECRET_KEY` is provided, Langflow automatically generates one.

For more information, see [Authentication](/configuration-authentication#langflow_secret_key).

## Revoke an API key

To revoke an API key, delete it from the list of keys in the **Settings** menu.

1. Click your user icon, and then select **Settings**.
2. Click **Langflow API**.
3. Select the keys you want to delete, and then click <Icon name="Trash2" aria-hidden="true"/> **Delete**.

This action immediately invalidates the key and prevents it from being used again.

## Add component API keys to Langflow

These are credentials for external services like OpenAI. They can be added to Langflow with the `.env` file or in the Langflow UI.

Component API keys that are set in the UI override those that are set in the environment variables.

### Add component API keys with the .env file

To add component API keys to your `.env` file:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
```

### Add component API keys with the Langflow UI

To add component API keys as **Global variables** with the Langflow UI:

1. Click your user icon, and then select **Settings**.
2. Click **Langflow API**.
3. Add new API keys as **Credential** type variables.
4. Apply them to specific component fields.

Component values set directly in a flow override values set in the UI **and** environment variables.

For more information, see [Global variables](/configuration-global-variables).
